Features of a Discrete Random Variable
- countable
- values are "discretized":
    - nothing in between the "discrete" values
    - 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 ... 10.0

Features of a Continuous Random Variable
- measurement problems
    - height of trees, building, etc
    - volume, mass, etc
- potential for infinite precision
    - if we have an infitinely precise instrument, we have "true continuity", an infinite of measurements between any two measurements.

Y_1 is a specific infinitely precise outcome from a continuous distribution with random variable Y. What is the probability of Y_1:  P(Y_1) = ?
0 because an infinitely precise value divided by an infinite number of outcomes is about as close to zero as you can get


in order to get a "specific" probability of a value from a continuous distribution, we in fact define a range.

CDF
to get the Proba of getting less than a given value
can also subtract two cdfs to get the probability of a range of values, thus discretizing our continuous distribution
