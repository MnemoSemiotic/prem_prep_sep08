Geometric Breakout 1
Suppose you have an unfair coin, with a 68% chance of getting tails. 
What is the probability that the first head will be on the 3rd trial?

Geometric Breakout 2
According to the article “Characterizing the Severity and Risk of Drought in the Poudre River, Colorado” taken from a water conservation journal, the drought length Y is the number of consecutive time intervals in which the water supply remains below a critical value y0 (a deficit), preceded by and followed by periods in which the supply exceeds this critical value (a surplus). The journal proposes a geometric distribution with  p = 0.409 for this random variable.
(hint: consider the probability p to represent the “success” of breaking a drought)
What is the probability that the drought lasts exactly three intervals?

Differentiating Binomial, Poisson, Geometric, and basic probability
'''
# Binomial
# What is the probability that some number out of some number of events is successful?
# p=0.7, n_trial = 5, what is the proba that 3 of the 5 trials are successful?

# Poisson
# On average, some number of events happens in this volume (of time, space, etc). 
# What is the probability of some (other) number of events happens in this volume or 
# some expansion/contraction of this volume?
# On avg 14 events occur in 5 minutes, what is the probability that 20 events occur 
# in 8 minutes?
